# CQUBeamerTemplate
It is a LaTex Beamer Template for Chongqing University. It is developed based on [njumath_beamer](https://github.com/YLiu1231/njumath_beamer).

This template can be used for academic reprot, conference or thesis defense, which is helpuful for one to deliver a speech. So i want to share it with all friends.

Here, I state that there is no copyright reserved. You can edit it, modify it, even crash it. Have fun!
